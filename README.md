Script Define Window
====================

A small window to run in the Unity Editor that allows you to quickly and easily modify your script definitions. This is invaluable when debugging and profiling, because you can quickly enable/disable chunks of code.

Access the window from the "Window/Script Defines" menu item.

Once the window is open, you can test that the tool is working by adding "SCRIPT_DEFINES_TEST". Click "Apply" in the top right corner of the window, and wait for the program to recompile. You should then see a text reading "Script Defines Test is Enabled!" at the bottom of the window.

Script defines can be toggled per-project by selecting the dropdown next to each definition.

This program is MIT licensed, so you can do whatever you want with it :)
